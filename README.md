# README

## Warning
The Readme is still a work in progress. It actually won't get you very far, because there's a lot of seed data you need to get going, and I don't have that in a useful format right now. So if you're trying to setup Dulu for whatever reason, let me know so I can help you out.

## For Development

### Prerequisites
* [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) - We're using rbenv and ruby 2.3.3.
* [PostGreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)

### Setup
1. Clone the repo.
    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/silcam/dulu.git
    ```

1. Create databases dulu_dev and dulu_test. See database.yml for the username and password to use.
   
    ```shell
    rails db:create
    ```
   
   Note: if you also need to drop the db, you can first run

    ```shell
    rails db:drop (if necessary)
    ```

1. Install bundler if you don't already have it

    ```shell
    gem install bundler
    ```

1. Install the necessary gems

    ```shell
    bundle install
    ```

1. yarn install

    ```shell
    yarn install
    ````

   If you don't have it, install [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/) first.

1. Initialize the development database by loading the schema

    ```shell
    rails db:schema:load
    ```

### Running the Tests

If you just want to run the tests, you can after a few more steps. The test database does not need to be seeded.

1. In `secrets.yml`, add Rails.application.secrets.smtp_username, set to something fake. (previously gmail_username,
   which is deprecated)

1. Run tests.

   See the definitions in `package.json` about the different testing options. For example, you can run `yarn test:most` to run the rails units and the jest tests.    
   

### Starting the Server

If you want to start the server to run this in a web browser, you need a few more steps.

1. You need to set up an omni auth config in `./config/initializers/omniauth.rb`. You can see the [Omniauth](https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth) documentation for how to do this.

1. You need to seed the database.
    
    ```shell
    rails db:seed RAILS_ENV=development
    ```

    This will insert some default data and create an admin user for you. Use one of your Google accounts.
    
1. Start the Server

    ```shell
    foreman s
    ```

1. Access Dulu at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
